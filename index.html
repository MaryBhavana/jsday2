      // Data types present in javascript(primitive) // Boolean-(true/false),
      strings-(words,sentences,words+numbers) // number-(integer and
      decimalvalues) // strings should have quotes in starting and ending

      //Variables-They are used to store the values which could be of any type
      //i.e number type or string type or boolean type

    
      //Rules for assigning names to variables //try to make the variable names
      declarative //it uses Camel case //Variable names are "case-sensitive"

  //let,var,const
  //......declaring/initializing/redeclaring........
//Let - These keywords are used to assign variables with values
//1.They can be declared in a line and then initialize with the valu in another linw
//2.They can also declared and initaizialised in the same line
//3.They cannot be redeclared.... but can be reinitialized perfect
//4.*****We cannot have two variables with same name in let****

/const - These keywords are used to assign variables with values
